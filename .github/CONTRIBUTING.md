# Making issues
The Issue tracker is NOT your personal support forum. It is intended to report
bugs and feature requests.

When making an issue, please keep to the [templates already provided](./ISSUE_TEMPLATE/). All
you have to do is submit a log file using the upload function, state the
version affected, and describe your problem. Failing to keep to this template
will have your issue closed almost immediately, and you may be blocked from creating issues in the future.

If submitting a feature request, state the version and description only.
(You do not need a log file or the behaviours section.)

Please make your titles descriptive of the problem/feature.
